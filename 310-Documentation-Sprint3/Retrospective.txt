Retrospective:

Based on the report feedback and demo feedback, our team have agreed upon that the following improvement measures will be taken: firstly, we need to keep up the constant pace work style, meaning write tests/codes and run them on Travis regularly and attach the commit links to the report. Secondly, we need to add more tasks on Asana based on demo feedback, implementation wise, we mainly missed the login/logout front-end and back-end, and we need to implement a collage to display Quick Access. For other backlogs, adjustments need to be taken, we know exactly the expectation so all we need is to get the job done.Thirdly, we need to be more careful on answering Simple Design and Refactoring in terms of making sure our answers satisfied the requirements and are relevant.
