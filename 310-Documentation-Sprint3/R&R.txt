1. Web application must be secure and protect confidentiality of a userâ€™s ImHungry data.
2. Maintain information beyond just a single session.
3. Allow for pagination of results returned by the search.
4. View results of prior searches by clicking on a quick access list that shows prior search terms.
5. User interfaces must look modern and be attractive.
6. Keep track of a grocery list for selected recipes.
7. Reorder any of the three predetermined lists.
8. Set the radius of the restaurant search.



Review:
Need user login. Hash function on storing passwords. Using Https protocol. Need front-end login/logout functionalities.
Need to store the reordered lists to database. Need to write tests for every single data type.
Default - display 5. If no search results, display error messages. Center the current page number. Last and top page should be something else.
Need a collage for quick access - inside each item there should be a minimized collage. It appears on search (not sure about format) & result page.
UI need a bigger Emoji to cover the text.
Need delete item functionality. Need entry to grocery list on every page.
Reorder - means reorder the items in the same page - need to store to database.
Radius - big bang. Unit is mile instead of meters.
